The Attributes of a Tree

Tree must have only one parent node except a root node.


Binary Tree
- It has 0 to 2 child nodes.
- Nodes that do not have any child nodes are called 'Leaf nodes' of
the binary tree.

Binary Search Tree
- BST has a relative ordering in how the nodes are organized,
while there is no ordering in Binary Tree.
- All the nodes to the left of a node have values less the value
of the right node, and all the nodes to the right of a node have values greater
than the value of the left node.
